#What problems were being solved in the projects?

The overall main goal of both projects was to work alongisde a group of advisors from a school's computer science program in order to develop a system that would allow the advisors to store/pull information related to the school's courses. 

Project 1 was focused on developing some basic pseudocode for different data structures in preparation for the system that would be developed soon. Project 1 also focused on analyzing the runtime complexity of each data structure and the pros/cons of each data structure. The main problem that needed solving in project 1 was which data structure should be used for storing and accesing data in the new system.

Project 2 was focused on the actual programming aspect of the course storing/accessing system. Project 2 required me to solve the problem of how I would actually implement and get the program to work in relation to the criteria listed by the users. In more specific terms, Project 2 required me to solve the problems of how the data would be read/stored, printed, and searched. I also had to solve problems related to error handling for incorrect user input.

#How did I approach the problem?

In regard to project 1, I approached the problem by first looking back at the past assignments we had to work on. There were 3 assignments we worked on in weeks prior where we had to develop some basic pseudocode for the course storing/accessing system. Each assignment required us to make the pseudocode work with a different data structure. (vector, hash table, and binary search tree) After looking at the 3 different pseudocodes, I had to determine their runtime, which I approached one data structure at a time. I first counted how many instructions there were, and then did some rough calculations of how long they would take to execute. Once I calculated the general runtimes (all were the same), I had to come to a decision of which data structure worked the best. I mainly based my decision off of the pros/cons of each data structure, but also my personal comfort level working with the data strucutres. In general, I tried to take things onestep at a time. First by working on the pseudocode, then the runtime analysis, and then coming to a decision.

In regard to project 2, I utilized a similar process that was used in project 1. I tried taking things step by step when developing the code for the course storing/accessing system. I first started off by developing the menu. I wanted to start with the menu since it was an easier portion of the project, but also because it was a good place to start in terms of building out from it. After developing the base menu, I went back and included some basic try/catch cases in order to handle some errors. After developing the menu, I decided to start working on the Node stuct, course sturct, and binary search tree class. The Node struct and Course stuct were pretty easy to develop since I had a bit of help from past assignments in the class. The binary search tree class took me a bit to develop since it required quite a lot of functions to be created. Despites this, the actual development of these functions was not hard. I had already developed similar functions in past assignments, so it was easy to replicate them. After I developed the binary search tree class, I chose to work on the open/parse function. I then decided to develop the search/print function which was not too hard since the search involved a binary search tree. All throughout this porcess, I was constantly running/testing my program making sure it worked correctly. After I ensured it worked correctly, I added documentation.

#How did I overcome any roadblocks I encountered?

When it came to roadblocks I encountered throughout the development of both projects, I had a few ways I handled them. My main way of overcoming roadblocks was to do some research online. I remember running into a few errors involving how the parsing portion of the open/parse function worked. It was opening, and reading the data correctly, but not parsing it correctly. The way I fixed this was by doing some research online about how I could parse using commas as a delim. I was able to figure out how to use the getline function in order to parse everything correctly, which made my program work perfectly. Another way I overcame roadblocks was by taking breaks when needed. At times, my progress would come to a halt, and I would not know exactly what to do in order to fix the problem. This sometimes made me a bit frustrated, so I made myself take a break in order to get my mind clear before focusing up again. After coming back iwth a clear mind, I was able to focus and figure things out. I used this method mostly when I was developing the search/print function. Especially the part involving printing the prereqs for each course.

#How has working on this project expanded my approach to designing software?

Personally, I feel that this project has made my approach to designing software much more efficient, as well as more refined. Prior to this class, I never really liked working on pseudocode. I found it to be somewhat tedious since it wasn't actual code. It felt easier to just dive straight into the coding process instead of preparing for it. Though, after the work in this class, I feel that using pseudocode is an important part in the process of developing code that is correct and works well. Even if it might take a bit more time to write pseudocode and write actual code, it makes the process of ensuring the users needs are met much easier. Another aspect of this class that has refined my approach to designing software was the analysis of different data structures. Doing the runtime anaylsis and storage analysis of each data structure in project 1 has made me realize how important it is to use the correct data structure for the situation.

#How has this project altered the way I write programs that are readable, maintainable, and adaptable?

Working on project 2 has made me realize how important it is to make my code maintainable, as well as adaptable. The criteria for project 2 was complex, but also nothing too crazy. There could have been much more asked to include such as adding or removing courses from the course list, which would also change the imported file. In order to make sure that this was possible, it was important that the code I wrote would be capable of being easily adapted to allow such feature additions. From now on, I plan on making sure my code is readily adaptable by considering possible additions or changes that might be made in the future and preparing for such changes. Project 2 has also made me realize that I do an okay job when it comes to readability, but I can still improve a lot. For one, I feel that the way I write documentation could be improved by consolidating it in certain parts. I could potentially make it so my spacing is a bit more neat and orderly.
